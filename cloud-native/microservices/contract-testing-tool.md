Pact is a code-first consumer-driven contract testing tool. 

Consumer contracts, also called Pacts, are defined in code and are generated after successfully running the consumer tests. 
The Pact files use JSON format and are used to spin up a Pact Mock Service to test and verify the compatibility of the provider API.
