Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is an infrastructure component that supports automatic test execution (and optionally deployments) in response to version control events such as pull requests and merges. 

CI/CD enables companies to implement quality gates such as unit tests, static analysis, or security analysis. Ultimately, CI/CD is a foundational tool in the cloud native ecosystem that can lead to substantial engineering efficiencies and reduced error counts.
